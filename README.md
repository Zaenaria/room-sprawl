# What is this?
This project exists to provide a simple and hopefully fun way of participating in Open Source Development.

# Is it for you?
If you're trying to get out there and contribute to some open source projects but feel a bit intimidated about getting your very first PR (Pull Request), this project might be for you!

# The game!
The project consists of a very simple little exploration game, called Room Sprawl. The player moves from room to room, sometimes picking up items and using them to unlock other rooms. 

Think a simple Zork type exploration game with buttons instead of text.

Have a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [HOW-TO-PLAY.md](HOW-TO-PLAY.md) to get started.
